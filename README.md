NCLDR
=====

NCLDR is an open source .NET port of [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) (the Common Locale Data Repository).

CLDR serves the same purpose as the .NET Framework's System.Globalization namespace and the culture data made available through the CultureInfo and RegionInfo classes. The difference, however, is that CLDR contains almost twice the number of cultures and includes additional data for each culture that is not included in the .NET Framework. NCLDR brings these cultures and this additional data to .NET developers.

##Status

NCLDR is currently an alpha release. It exists as a preview that lets you view the potential of a complete product.

What is complete:-
* Most of the CLDR data is exposed through NCLDR
* Support for creating .NET custom cultures from CLDR data is mostly complete
* Many extension methods exist to expose CLDR data through .NET CultureInfo and RegionInfo classes
* The NCLDRExplorer to view NCLDR data is mostly complete

What is still to do:-
* In general the main part of NCLDR that is currently missing is a layer of intelligence on top of the data that makes the data valuable.
